## This is a collection of Data Science projects from academia/extracurricular work. Below are the contents of each file.
### Makins-Elliott-problem4and5.ipynb:
- This is a piece of coursework exploring the use of linear regression to predict Olympic Games results using population, GDP and Previous Preformance. I achieved a grade of 89% for this.
### Makins-Elliott-problem9and10.ipynb:
- This is a piece of coursework exploring the use of random forrests and simple neural networks to predict mushroom edibility based off cap properties, smell, height and more.I achieved a grade of 80% for this.
### Makins-Elliott-week6and7.ipynb:
- This is a piece of coursework exploring the use of logistic regression and decision trees to explore brexit voting data based off education, age, income and more. I achieved a grade of 92% for this.
### GitTitanic.ipynb:
- This is a Kaggle competition where the passengers survving the titanic is predicted from information such as age, sex, number of siblings on board, ticket number, cabin, and more. I used random forrests in this file but explored logisitc regression aswell. Achived a final accuracy of 78% ranking in the 74th percentile.
